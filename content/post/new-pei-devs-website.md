+++


In July 2015 the group determined we should have some web presence to create a compilation of all of our resources in one area. [Michael](https://twitter.com/codetojoy) stepped up and created us a very simple bootstrap website with all of the resources jammed on the site to have the single source of information we desired.

We knew this was never going to have this as a long term solution and started thinking about what we wanted for a website. September of 2015 an [issue](https://github.com/peidevs/peidevs.github.io/issues/2) was logged to start revamping to have a proper website.Â <span style="font-size: 1rem;">Around this time we met the folks at </span><a href="https://forestry.io/" style="font-size: 1rem; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Forestry.io</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> who introduced us to static website generators </span><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" style="font-size: 1rem; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Jekyll</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> and </span><a href="https://gohugo.io/" style="font-size: 1rem; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Hugo</a>

The rest of this document will talk about the technical hurdles and lessons learned from this project.
